_annoying things that developers still continue to do_




### Settings and personalisation
---

- **Launchers with settings that are not available inside the game**
    - Why do some games not let you change the graphics settings in-game? Is it really that hard to do, because I think 90% of games allow you to nowadays.
    
    e.g. _Fallout 4_, _Skyrim_
- **Settings menus only accessible while playing**
    - Who actually thought not being able to change the volume of the game until you've started your save and sat through an eardrum-bursting intro cutscene
    was a good idea?
    
    e.g. _Sword Art Online: Alicization Lycoris_
- **Audio and graphics settings only activated when you press apply**
    - Can't tell what you're gonna end up with and if it's actually acceptable
- **Non-rebindable controls**
    - Be nice to left-handed people.
    
    e.g. _A lot of games_
- **No accessibility options**
    - Colourblind filters, reading out of text and selected menu items.
- **Games being loud on start-up**
    - OS's at 100% volume are actually pretty loud. Why not set the default volume of your game to 50% so that we can keep our ears.
    
    e.g. _Every game ever_
    
### Quality of life during gameplay
---

- **Divergent paths with no indication where the story is, and where side content is**
    - Being in a cave and being presented with two different paths is incredibly frustrating for completionists and people who like to grab everything, or check everywhere, they can.
    It's a 50/50 chance that you'll go the way you want to, or instead be thrust into a boss fight and/or cutscene that could then subsequently take you out of the area which
    you can never go back to again. **Pain**.
    
    e.g. _So, so many games_
    
- **Unskippable cutscenes or dialogue sections**
    - Even in a story-based game, like _Life is Strange_, parts should be skippable. Someone who has already played the games and wants to skip certain bits should be allowed to.
    
    e.g. _Dragon Quest_
- **Escort and follow missions**
    - The NPC always walks faster than you when you are walking, and slower than you when you are sprinting. Just make them the same.
        - Or do what Shadow of Mordor does during follow segments, and let the game control your character for you and walk alongside the NPC you are following.
    
    e.g. _Assassin's Creed_
    
- **Collectables that aren't tracked in an open world game**
    - That's a lot of stuff you want the completionists to pick up, and you're not even going to give them a hand. Even worse, some games make you _pay_ (real money) for a map of all those items.
    
    e.g. _Assassin's Creed_
    
- **Intrusive tutorials**
    - Tutorials that show up in a box that takes up your entire screen that you then have to press OK to close.
      - **Unless** it's a tutorial in the middle of a fight and it's showing you what to do based on timing during the fight.
      
- **Duplicated tutorials**
    - Some games show you how to move at the beginning, and then once again later on as if that isn't what I've been doing this entire time.
    
- **Non-skippable tutorials**
    - If someone's playing the game again we don't need that. 
      - **Unless** it's baked into the actual game and/or provided by tips that appear on screen.
      Basically, don't take us to a magical location just for teaching us how to play when we already know and then drop us into the real game.
